# MENC Theme Docs

This project contains both a [theme prototype](https://michiganengineering.github.io/menc-theme-docs/) and a 
[theme style guide](https://michiganengineering.github.io/menc-theme-docs/styleguide.html). The [Zurb template for Foundation for sites](https://github.com/zurb/foundation-zurb-template) 
is used to generate both documents, you can find instructions for working with the project source there.  
  
This project and these documents are largely for providing technical support to outside vendors working with our departments 
and units. While issues and pull requests to this repo will be monitored it is unlikely they will be accepted or acted upon 
unless directly related to the contents of this specific project.
